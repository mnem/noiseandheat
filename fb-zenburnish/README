popular amongst vimheads.

   current preferences somewhere.
4. Keep that backup safe in case this all goes titsup.
5. Choose File -> Export -> Other
6. Open General and select Preferences.
7. Browse to where you've downloaded fb-zenburnish.epf and select it. Make
   sure "Import all" is selected, ignore any warnings and hit "Finish".
8. Panic, as your colours look crazy-ass.
9. Choose File -> Restart to reload Eclipse.
10.Exhale gently and let the sublime colours wash, soothingly, through your
   eyeballs, caressing your optic nerves, and then engaging in a group hug
   with your brain.
